# Moving to New York 0#

## My journey from Rio de Janeiro to the NYU ##

This project is part of my master’s Thesis in Arts and Neuroscience, defended in 2017. I developed a Virtual Reality Experience in Unity to provide the Neurosciences lab to create specific subtle experiences in order to better understand how emotions work and how machines can capture them. Together with my teacher José Otávio, the project is going through extensive user testing, where volunteers go through this unsettling experience while wearing Empatica G4 Electrodermal sensors that transmit their neurological and biological data to an Ipad.
