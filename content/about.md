## This is the creative lab of Gabriel Brasil

I'm a designer, journalist and technologist, mixing and matching the new with the unexpected. Currently a Graduate student at the NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program.

Eject Now is a creative lab for web design disguised as my personal portfolio. Here you will find some projects, works and sketches for clients, academia or just plain personal gratification.
