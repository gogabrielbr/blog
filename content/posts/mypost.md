# This is my post!
## The first one using propper markdown

After each day I decided to star writing some random stuff just to have some idea on how a propper markdown paragraph would look lie in this website. But is this the best way to write? Should I really be writtin all this nonsens? Writing is the sort of thing that I have a hard time doing.
